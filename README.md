This Python script creates a simple Tkinter-based GUI where users can interact with a chatbot (BankBot) to ask banking-related questions. The user submits a form with personal details, and the chatbot provides a response. A PDF is then generated, logging the question, response, and user data. The application supports inquiries like checking balance, applying for a loan, opening a new account, or closing an account.
